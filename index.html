<p>This is my little corner of the internet, where I solemnly stay and sulk when I get upset about how corporatised the rest of it is.</p>
<p>Come see my rambling's on <a href="https://im-in.space/@lustronomy" rel="me">my mastodon</a>. Tell me anything.</p>
<p>My interests are more like laptop stickers being buried under each other than continuous hobbies or passions, but the big few are tech, cats, music and coffee. Talk to me about any of those!</p>
